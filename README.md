# Believe in Rails Magic? Unlock the Powers of Rails
Â 
Poof! Before your eyes is a full-stack exercise tracking application utilizing rails forms. How did it get there? During this workshop, we're going to help you understand Rails magic! This workshop is perfect for Rails beginners who are looking to get a better understanding of the magic happening inside of Rails. We're going to teach how to build a full-stack rails exercise tracking application that allows the user to retrieve information from the database as well as add content to the database. You will also learn about mapping CRUD actions to HTTP verbs to RESTful routes. As well as following developer flow to implement routes, controller methods, and views for RESTful routes. Then, at the end of the workshop, everything will come together, and you will understand some of the amazing magic hidden inside of Rails!
